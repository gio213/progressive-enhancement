        Up in space, turning around, looking at the earth’s face. From that
        rock’s perspective on Mars or that gaz opinion from Jupiter, nothing
        cares about your problems. Up there, it’s just not serious, and there’s
        no such thing as an issue. Down here, the only reality is the one inside
        our brain. Nothing exists if the brain doesn’t think it. Nothing exists
        neither if our senses don’t transmit the message. That means that if we
        mis sense, our reality changes. That’s possible because our perception
        is limited : you can’t see at 360 degrees for example. If we mis
        translate the message, our reality changes. If we think it in a way, our
        reality changes depending on that way. Therefore, if we can change
        reality that much, everything’s fake. They’re proofs to that. Fall in
        love with someone and you’ll see that person as divine. Pull yourself
        out of that grip and the divine falls from clouds to solid ground,
        revealing him or herself differently. But the person is the same, you
        just changed your mind. Everything works like that : it’s not just that
        you can make your world, it’s that you passively do it anyway.

      <p>
        Once upon a time there was a Chinese farmer whose horse ran away. That
        evening, all of his neighbors came around to commiserate. They said, “We
        are so sorry to hear your horse has run away. This is most unfortunate.”
        The farmer said, “Is it <em class="good">good?</em> Is it
        <em class="bad">bad</em>? I don't know.” The next day the horse came
        back bringing seven wild horses with it, and in the evening everybody
        came back and said, “Oh, isn’t that lucky. What a great turn of events.
        You now have eight horses!” The farmer again said, “Is it
        <em class="good">good?</em> Is it <em class="bad">bad</em>? I don't
        know.” The following day his son tried to break one of the horses, and
        while riding it, he was thrown and broke his leg. The neighbors then
        said, “Oh dear, that’s too <em class="bad">bad</em>,” and the farmer
        responded, “Is it <em class="good">good?</em> Is it
        <em class="bad">bad</em>? I don't know.” The next day the conscription
        officers came around to conscript people into the army, and they
        rejected his son because he had a broken leg. Again all the neighbors
        came around and said, “Isn’t that great!” Again, he said, “Is it<em
          class="good"
          >good?</em
        >
        Is it <em class="bad">bad</em>? I don't know.” The whole process of
        nature is an integrated process of immense complexity, and it’s really
        impossible to tell whether anything that happens in it is
        <em class="good">good?</em> or <em class="bad">bad</em> — because you
        never know what will be the consequence of the misfortune; or, you never
        know what will be the consequences of <em class="good">good?</em>
        fortune. Alan Watts

      <h1>Conclusion</h1>
      <p>
        <em class="good">good?</em> and <em class="bad">Bad</em> are just one
        perspective. Bananas are <em class="good">good?</em> for monkeys, but
        monkeys are not <em class="good">good?</em> for bananas. Let's not make
        a big deal out of it...
